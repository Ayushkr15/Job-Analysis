## **Steps in the Project 🖌️**

### **1. 📊 Data Gathering**
#### **Methods Used**:
- **Web Scraping 🔧**:
  - Scraped job listings from popular job portals using Python libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `Selenium`.
  - Targeted data fields included job titles, company 🏢 names, 📍 locations, minimum and maximum salaries, and required experience.

#### **Tools and Libraries 📚**:
- `BeautifulSoup` and `Selenium` for scraping job data.
- `pandas` for organizing scraped data into structured tabular formats.

#### **Challenges ❗**:
- Inconsistent formatting of job titles and missing data fields.
- Dynamic content on websites handled using Selenium to automate browser actions.

---

### **2. 📊 Data Collection**
The collected dataset contained the following fields:
- **🔖 Job Title**: Title of the job posting.
- **💼 Company Name**: Organization offering the job.
- **📍 Location**: City or region of the job posting.
- **💸 Minimum and Maximum Salary**: Salary range specified in the job listing.
- **📅 Required Experience**: Minimum and maximum years of experience needed.
- **🔗 Job Link**: URL to the job posting.
- **🛠️ Skills**: Specific skills required for the job.

#### **Dataset Summary 🔹**:
- Number of Records: 987 job listings.
- Columns: `jobTitle`, `company`, `location`, `jobLink`, `skills`, `experience_min`, `experience_max`, `min_salary`, `max_salary`.
- Format: CSV file containing structured data.

### **3. 🔄 Data Preprocessing**
#### **Steps ➕**:
1. **Cleaning the Data 🌌**:
   - Removed duplicates.
   - Handled missing values by imputation or dropping rows/columns.
2. **Standardizing Fields ⚖️**:
   - Converted salary and experience columns to numerical formats.
   - Standardized job titles by lowercasing and removing special characters.
3. **Feature Engineering ⚛️**:
   - Calculated average salary using minimum and maximum salary fields.
   - Extracted `industry` categories from job titles using custom Python logic.
   - Computed average experience using `experience_min` and `experience_max`.

#### **Libraries Used 📚**:
- `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization 🗺.
- `re` for regular expressions to clean job titles.

---

### **4. 🌐 Industry Categorization**
A custom Python function categorized job titles into industries:
- **Logic 🔀**:
  - Keywords like "Data Analyst", "Frontend Developer", "Python Developer" matched to industries like "Analytics", "Frontend Development", "Software Development".
- **Output 📈**:
  - Created a new `industry` column for easy grouping and analysis.

### **5. 🔎 Data Analysis**
#### **Graphs and Insights 🔀**:

1. **🔽 Industry vs. Average Salary**:
   - Bar chart visualizing the average salary across industries.

2. **⏳ Industry vs. Average Experience**:
   - Bar chart showcasing average experience required by industry.

3. **🌍 Location vs. Salary**:
   - Choropleth map highlighting average salaries across Indian cities.
